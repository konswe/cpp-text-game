# cpp-text-game
----fun project to learn more about cpp----
Im learning cpp and wanted to do something bigger so i decided to use my imagination and created this game. I have started on 23.05.2022. I will update this as much as i can. I hope you will like it :)).

First day ended i have so much more ideas

I'm starting to add weapons and after that some fighting mechanics and game will be playable, after that i will add armor, some stats and more enemies.
At the end i will add plot and make it as much interesting as i can. :))
